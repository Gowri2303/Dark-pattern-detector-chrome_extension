# Dark-pattern-detector-chrome_extension
Dark Pattern Detector is a Chrome extension that helps users browse the web more safely by exposing dark patterns — deceptive design tricks used to pressure users into making decisions.

**The extension currently supports the following categories**:

Countdown → Fake urgency with timers (e.g., “Offer ends in 2 minutes”).

Scarcity → Claims of limited availability (e.g., “Only 2 items left!”).

Social Proof → Manipulative popularity cues (e.g., “100 people just bought this”).

Forced Continuity → Hidden auto-renewals or forced subscriptions.

**How it Works**

When browsing a website, the extension automatically scans the page content.

The popup shows a counter of detected patterns.

0 = Safe (green) → No dark patterns found.

1 or more = Warning (red) → Dark patterns detected.
